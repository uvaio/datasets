## Description

Data for the information organisation project. Includes:

* **Data Models:** processed and modeled origin dataset
* **Machine Learning:** Jupyter notebooks for machine learning part
* **Ontology:** ontology of the dataset
* **Datasets:** Aggregated data used in the web-based visualiations

### Machine Learning

There are 2 python scripts. process_dataset.py takes the originald dataset and selects the columns of interest. machine_learning.py is the main script of interest, that includes the generation of the model, training, validation & prediction. original_dataset.csv is the original dataset necesarry for running the scripts.
